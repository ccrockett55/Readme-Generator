# README File Generator

## Project Description

https://readme-generator-a1228.web.app/

I created this generator because as a someone still fairly new to software development I was not able to find a simple, easy to use README file generator. I felt it was important to have something that could walk me through creating a README file for a project step-by-step. By breaking the project down into questions that can be answered and then combining those answers into one document, I was able to accomplish a simplistic way of creating a README document. 

## Built With
